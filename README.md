## Project Overview
The COVID-19 Analysis project aims to provide insights into the ongoing pandemic by analyzing data related to the spread and impact of the COVID-19 virus using SQL. The project uses SQL as the primary query language to query and analyze data from various sources, including global and regional COVID-19 datasets, population demographics, and other relevant data.

## The project is organized into several main components:
- Data collection and preprocessing: The project includes SQL scripts to collect and preprocess data from various sources, including global and regional COVID-19 datasets, population demographics, and other relevant data.
- Data analysis: The project includes SQL queries that perform analysis on the collected data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to COVID-19.
- Documentation: The project includes detailed documentation on the project structure, data sources, methodology, and findings to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
## Data Sources 
- The COVID-19 Analysis project uses data from various sources, including public datasets, APIs, and official COVID-19 data repositories. The data sources used in this project include:
- Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) COVID-19 Data Repository: This dataset provides daily updated data on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries at the global, country, and regional levels.
- World Bank Open Data: This dataset provides socio-economic and demographic data that can be used to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different populations and regions.

## Analysis
- The COVID-19 Analysis project includes various SQL queries for analysis, such as:
- Querying COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries at the global, country, and regional levels.
- Performing aggregations, joins, and filtering to identify trends and patterns in COVID-19 data.
- Calculating summary statistics and generating visualizations using SQL.
- Conducting time-series analysis and trend analysis using SQL.
